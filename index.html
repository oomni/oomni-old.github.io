	 <h1>What's the Omni?</h1>
	 <p><b>#1</b>
		The Omni is a building in Temescal, Oakland, CA. It was built in the 1930s by
		an Italian-American garbage workers' union. They built a theater, barroom, and
		boccee ball court. Over the years it also accumulated two industrial kitchens, a
		jaccuzzi room, a large basement library, and a disco dance hall. At some point
		in the 1980s the disco hall became a death metal club - they named it the Omni.
		After many noise complaints, the neighborhood shut it down and it became a
		private residence.

		The Omni Collective is many local groups pooling our resources and efforts to
		take this building off the market and turn it into a public commons, free for
		everybody. All our groups believe in public service, accessibility, social 
		justice, grassroots activism, civic engagement, and serving our many communities.
		We all struggle or just can't afford to pay our city's increasing rent prices,
		because we are <i>not</i> about the money. We can only survive if we join together.

	 <h1>Who are these groups?</h1>
	 <p><b>Sudo Room</b>
		is a free community space for hackers, artists, activists, our communities, and
		the people of Oakland. We opened downtown in 2012. We offer free workshops where 
		anybody can learn programming, linux, 3D printing, electronic music, and more.
		We're building a free wifi network that will eventually cover the city. We host 
		meetups for the Oakland Wiki, a free website about Oakland that anybody can edit.
		We hold regular events about digital privacy and government surveillance. We also
		host many other activist groups and political events. All our events are 100% 
		donation-based and free to the public.
	 </p>
	 <p><b>Bay Area Public School</b>
		hosts free classes, reading groups, poetry readings, language learning groups,
		and many more things. This is a stub and a BAPS person should finish it?
